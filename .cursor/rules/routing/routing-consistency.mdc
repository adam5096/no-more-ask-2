# Rule: Routing & API Consistency

This rule ensures semantic alignment between Page Routing and BFF Paths.

## Terminology Alignment
- **Resource Naming:** If a Page represents a "Product", the corresponding BFF API must also use the word "Product".
  - *Example:* Page `/inventory` should NOT have a BFF `/api/stock-items`. Keep them both as `inventory` or `stock`.

## Parameter Mapping
- **Identity Consistency:** Use the same key names for dynamic parameters across layers.
  - If a page route is `/order/[orderId]`, the BFF call must be `/api/order/[orderId]/details`. 
  - Do not switch between `id`, `uuid`, and `orderId` arbitrarily.

## Workflow
- When creating a new feature, always verify that the BFF path semantic structure mirrors the Page route it serves.
